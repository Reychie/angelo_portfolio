            I&apos;m Angelo Reychie Alejo, a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building applications and figuring out how different parts of a system work together. I like taking a requirement or problem, understanding what needs to be done, and turning it into a working feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of my experience has involved building new features, fixing issues, improving existing systems, and working with other developers on real projects. I&apos;m comfortable learning things as I go, especially when a project requires something I haven&apos;t worked with before.
          </p>

            Outside of coding, I spend a lot of time reading and watching videos about astronomy, space exploration, and the universe. Space has always been something I&apos;m interested in, and it&apos;s usually what I end up reading about when I&apos;m away from development.
